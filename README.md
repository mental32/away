# Away
## A Modern, Idiomatic, Asynchronous Python 3 Wayland Protocol library. 

## Abstract

Away is a Wayland protocol library written for the asynchronous Python stack.

Given that Wayland describes itself as an asynchronous object oriented
protocol and that coincidentally these are also two of Python's strengths
(due to its object oriented nature and the mature async environment) I figured
why not put the two together in a well done design.


## Examples

```py
import asyncio

from away import Display

server = Display()

@server.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
